# 💻 Software Engineering 2 Project

## 📖 Overview

This project, developed as part of the Software Engineering 2 course at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, focuses on creating a robust server using Swagger Codegen in accordance with the OpenAPI Specification. The primary objective is to facilitate efficient API design, implementation, and comprehensive testing of API calls.

## 🎯 Goals

- **📘 API-First Development**: Employ Swagger Codegen to generate server stubs from OpenAPI specifications, promoting a design-first methodology.
- **🔗 RESTful API Implementation**: Construct a RESTful API that adheres to industry best practices for resource management.
- **🛠️ Comprehensive Testing**: Develop extensive test cases to ensure API reliability and performance.
- **📄 Interactive Documentation**: Utilize Swagger UI to provide real-time API interaction and testing capabilities.

---

## ✨ Features

- **📋 Swagger Integration**: Server stub generation using Swagger Codegen for streamlined API development.
- **📂 RESTful Endpoints**: Implementation of RESTful API endpoints managing various resources efficiently.
- **🧪 Extensive Test Cases**: Development of test cases to validate API functionality and robustness.
- **⚙️ Middleware Support**: Integration with [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) for request validation, routing, and enhanced middleware support.
- **📄 Interactive Documentation**: Access to Swagger UI for real-time API interaction, testing, and comprehensive documentation.

## 🚀 Running the Server

To run the server, execute:

```bash
npm start
```

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
